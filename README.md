# Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and iOS

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fcm.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/fcm) [![Build Status](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/decision-labs/fcm/actions)

The FCM gem lets your ruby backend send notifications to Android and iOS devices via [
Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/).

## Installation

```sh
gem install fcm
```

or in your `Gemfile` just include it:

```ruby
gem 'fcm'
```

## Requirements

For Android you will need a device running 2.3 (or newer) that also have the Google Play Store app installed, or an emulator running Android 2.3 with Google APIs. iOS devices are also supported.

A version of supported Ruby, currently:
`ruby >= 2.4`

## Getting Started

To use this gem, you need to instantiate a client with your firebase credentials:

```ruby
fcm = FCM.new(
  nil,
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_PATH,
  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
)
```

## About the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_PATH`

The `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_PATH` is meant to contain your firebase credentials. See the [Firebase V1 Migration docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1#provide-credentials-manually) for instructions to create a private key file.

The easiest way to provide them is to pass here an absolute path to a file with your credentials:

```ruby
fcm = FCM.new(
  nil,
  '/path/to/credentials.json',
  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
)
```

As per their secret nature, you might not want to have them in your repository. In that case, another supported solution is to pass a `StringIO` that contains your credentials:

```ruby
fcm = FCM.new(
  nil,
  StringIO.new(ENV.fetch('FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS')),
  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
)

```

## Usage

## HTTP v1 API

To migrate to HTTP v1 see: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1

```ruby
fcm = FCM.new(
  nil,
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_PATH,
  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
)
message = {
  'topic': "89023", # OR token if you want to send to a specific device
  # 'token': "000iddqd",
  'data': {
    payload: {
      data: {
        id: 1
      }
    }.to_json
  },
  'notification': {
    title: notification.title_th,
    body: notification.body_th,
  },
  'android': {},
  'apns': {
    payload: {
      aps: {
        sound: "default",
        category: "#{Time.zone.now.to_i}"
      }
    }
  },
  'fcm_options': {
    analytics_label: 'Label'
  }
}

fcm.send_v1(message)
```

## HTTP Legacy Version

To migrate to HTTP v1 see: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1

For your server to send a message to one or more devices, you must first initialise a new `FCM` class with your Firebase Cloud Messaging server key, and then call the `send` method on this and give it 1 or more (up to 1000) registration tokens as an array of strings. You can also optionally send further [HTTP message parameters](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref) like `data` or `time_to_live` etc. as a hash via the second optional argument to `send`.

Example sending notifications:

```ruby
require 'fcm'

fcm = FCM.new("my_server_key")

registration_ids= ["12", "13"] # an array of one or more client registration tokens

# See https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref for all available options.
options = { "notification": {
              "title": "Portugal vs. Denmark",
              "body": "5 to 1"
          }
}
response = fcm.send(registration_ids, options)
```

Currently `response` is just a hash containing the response `body`, `headers` and `status_code`. Check [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server#response) to see how to interpret the responses.

## Device Group Messaging

With [device group messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/notifications), you can send a single message to multiple instance of an app running on devices belonging to a group. Typically, "group" refers a set of different devices that belong to a single user. However, a group could also represent a set of devices where the app instance functions in a highly correlated manner. To use this feature, you will first need an initialised `FCM` class.

### Generate a Notification Key for device group

Then you will need a notification key which you can create for a particular `key_name` which needs to be uniquely named per app in case you have multiple apps for the same `project_id`. This ensures that notifications only go to the intended target app. The `create` method will do this and return the token `notification_key`, that represents the device group, in the response:

```ruby
params = {key_name: "appUser-Chris",
                project_id: "my_project_id",
                registration_ids: ["4", "8", "15", "16", "23", "42"]}
response = fcm.create(*params.values)
```

### Send to Notification Key

Now you can send a message to a particular `notification_key` via the `send_with_notification_key` method. This allows the server to send a single [data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#data_messages) payload or/and [notification](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications) payload to multiple app instances (typically on multiple devices) owned by a single user (instead of sending to some registration tokens). Note: the maximum number of members allowed for a `notification_key` is 20.

```ruby
response = fcm.send_with_notification_key("notification_key",
            data: {score: "3x1"},
            collapse_key: "updated_score")
```

### Add/Remove Registration Tokens

You can also add/remove registration Tokens to/from a particular `notification_key` of some `project_id`. For example:

```ruby
params = { key_name: "appUser-Chris",
                project_id: "my_project_id",
                notification_key:"appUser-Chris-key",
                registration_ids:["7", "3"] }
response = fcm.add(*params.values)

params = { key_name: "appUser-Chris",
                project_id: "my_project_id",
                notification_key:"appUser-Chris-key",
                registration_ids:["8", "15"] }
response = fcm.remove(*params.values)
```

## Send Messages to Topics

FCM [topic messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/topic-messaging) allows your app server to send a message to multiple devices that have opted in to a particular topic. Based on the publish/subscribe model, topic messaging supports unlimited subscriptions per app. Sending to a topic is very similar to sending to an individual device or to a user group, in the sense that you can use the `fcm.send_with_notification_key()` method where the `notification_key` matches the regular expression `"/topics/[a-zA-Z0-9-_.~%]+"`:

```ruby
response = fcm.send_with_notification_key("/topics/yourTopic",
            notification: {body: "This is a FCM Topic Message!"})
```

Or you can use the helper:

```ruby
response = fcm.send_to_topic("yourTopic",
            notification: {body: "This is a FCM Topic Message!"})
```

### Sending to Multiple Topics

To send to combinations of multiple topics, the FCM [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message#send_messages_to_topics_2) require that you set a **condition** key (instead of the `to:` key) to a boolean condition that specifies the target topics. For example, to send messages to devices that subscribed to _TopicA_ and either _TopicB_ or _TopicC_:

```
'TopicA' in topics && ('TopicB' in topics || 'TopicC' in topics)
```

FCM first evaluates any conditions in parentheses, and then evaluates the expression from left to right. In the above expression, a user subscribed to any single topic does not receive the message. Likewise, a user who does not subscribe to TopicA does not receive the message. These combinations do receive it:

- TopicA and TopicB
- TopicA and TopicC

You can include up to five topics in your conditional expression, and parentheses are supported. Supported operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`. Note the usage for !:

```
!('TopicA' in topics)
```

With this expression, any app instances that are not subscribed to TopicA, including app instances that are not subscribed to any topic, receive the message.

The `send_to_topic_condition` method within this library allows you to specicy a condition of multiple topics to which to send to the data payload.

```ruby
response = fcm.send_to_topic_condition(
  "'TopicA' in topics && ('TopicB' in topics || 'TopicC' in topics)",
  notification: {
    body: "This is an FCM Topic Message sent to a condition!"
  }
)
```

## Subscribe the client app to a topic

Given a registration token and a topic name, you can add the token to the topic using the [Google Instance ID server API](https://developers.google.com/instance-id/reference/server).

```ruby
topic = "YourTopic"
registration_id= "12" # a client registration tokens
response = fcm.topic_subscription(topic, registration_id)
```

Or you can manage relationship maps for multiple app instances [Google Instance ID server API. Manage relationship](https://developers.google.com/instance-id/reference/server#manage_relationship_maps_for_multiple_app_instances)

```ruby
topic = "YourTopic"
registration_ids= ["4", "8", "15", "16", "23", "42"] # an array of one or more client registration tokens
response = fcm.batch_topic_subscription(topic, registration_ids)
# or unsubscription
response = fcm.batch_topic_unsubscription(topic, registration_ids)
```
